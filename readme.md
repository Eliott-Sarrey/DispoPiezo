# PRESSURE SENSOR WARNING

The voltage input has to be on and set on 24V C.V. Turning off the engine of the pressure generator, the current used by the sensor should be at least 4mA. If less, please check the cables!

# BEFORE ANY MEASUREMENT

The pressure sensor allows to measure precisely the chamber between 0 and 2.5 bars. Hence, in order to access to the pressure value for all t, one should be careful to have a positive pressure only inside the chamber. This imply to set the pressure inside the chamber to the atmospheric pressure when the piston is in its uncompressed position. It might be required to repeat the procedure before any measurement because of pressure loss in pipe.

# JUPYTER NOTEBOOK

You might experience a run time error when running the jupyter notebook. The cell taking the measurement should not take much longer than the measurement duration itself. If it happened, one should restart the kernel using the turning arrow button and then rerun the notebook.
